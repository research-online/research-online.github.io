Ben is an applied economist working on the environmental, biodiversity and behavioural economics. One area of his research concerns social preferences for intertemporal social decisions and intergenerational equity. His empirical and theoretical work has focussed on the social discount rate for evaluating long-term public policy issues such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. This work has informed government policy guidance on Cost Benefit Analysis and the Social Cost of Carbon in the US, UK, Norway and the Netherlands. In parallel with work on social preferences for risk, time and inequality, another part of Benâ€™s research  asks questions about the determinants of individual preferences and political opinions: How do people internalise uncertainty in their decision making? Do preferences respond to traumatic experiences? Does the experience of violence increase the support for violent political actions? He is currently a professor of Biodiversity Economics at the Department of Economics at Exeter University, and a visiting Professor at the Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and Environment at the London School of Economics.
